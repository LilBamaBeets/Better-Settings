This is a thing I made because I was bored and it changes the windows theme to "Dark Mode". It also has a button labelled "Admin Unlocked", which just ends the process "explorer.exe" because funny, if you use this and you cannot re-enable it, you can click the hidden button to the right of the exit button (i added this cos my school, which i wanted to use this in but they blocked using os module because security, blocked task manager.
